roullete_game<br>
The game is divided to 3 classes - credits , wheel , game.<br>
On start you get 100 credits to guess the right number.<br>
If you guess right you win 36 credits<br>
<br>
dockerfile<br>
by useing the docker build -t #NAME# .<br>
and docker -i run #NAME#<br>
the roullete game will start in a container.<br>
the -i flag is set because the game is interactive.<br>
One thing will be different - the 'clear' command (to clear the console) won't work<br>
