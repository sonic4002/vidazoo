roullete_game
            The game is divided to 3 classes - credits , wheel , game.
            On start you get 100 credits to guess the right number.
            If you guess right you win 36 credits
            
dockerfile
            by useing the docker build -t #NAME# .
            and docker -i run #NAME#
            the roullete game will start in a container.
            the -i flag is set because the game is interactive.
            One thing will be different - the 'clear' command (to clear the console) won't work
